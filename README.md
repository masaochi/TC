# TC++
Version 1.3 (2023/12/26)

TC++ is a first-principles calculation code using the Hartree-Fock (HF) and the transcorrelated (TC) methods for periodic systems.

## Supported functionalities
- Free-electron mode (FREE), HF, TC, BITC (biorthogonal TC)
- SCF and band calculations
- (from ver.1.3) Cell-fixed structural optimization for HF and BITC. Hellmann--Feynman theorem holds for BITC but not for TC.
- Solid-state calculation under the periodic boundary condition. Homogeneous-electron-gas calculation using a periodic cell is also possible.
- Plane-wave basis set
- Norm-conserving pseudopotentials without partial core correction (available, e.g., in [Pseudopotential Library](https://pseudopotentiallibrary.org/))
- For spin-polarized calculation, only spin-collinear calculation without spin-orbit coupling is available.
- Monkhorst-Pack k-grid with/without a shift. A k-grid should not break any crystal symmetry.
- RPA-type Jastrow factor

## Installation
Download the compressed source file and unzip it (see Releases or Tags). Then, there are two ways for installation:

(1) `cd src` and edit [`Makefile`](./src/Makefile) to specify the following compilers and libraries except Quantum ESPRESSO. Finally, typing `make` will create an execution file named `tc++` in `src`.

(2) `cmake` is also available for installation. Type `mkdir build && cd build`, `cmake ..`, `make`, and `make install` to create an execution file named `tc++`. For several options for `cmake`, please see [User's Guide](https://TCplusplus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html). For example, `cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=icpc -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=ifort -DEIGEN3_INCLUDE=/usr/local/eigen-3.4.0 -DFFTW_INCLUDE=/usr/local/fftw-3.3.10/include -DFFTW_LIB=/usr/local/fftw-3.3.10/lib -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/home/ochi/TC++ ..` will create `tc++` in `/home/ochi/TC++/bin` (NOTE: `bin` is added to CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX).

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (C++11 or newer)
- Fortran compiler (Fortran 2003 or newer)
- MPI library
- [Boost C++ library](https://www.boost.org/)
- [FFTW3 library](https://www.fftw.org/) (Note: If you compiled FFTW with the Intel compiler, please compile TC++ with the Intel compiler to avoid some errors.)
- [Eigen3 library](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/)
- [Quantum ESPRESSO](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/) (ver.6.2 or newer) is used in precalculation to get several information such as an initial guess of one-electron orbitals. TC++ requires xml and wfc files dumped by QE.

To verify that your installation was successfully done, a test suite is provided.
Type `cd test` and copy `tc++` into `test` directory. Then, you can perform a test calculation by typing `python3 test.py`.
